Law by Keystone: A Catholic-Focused Development Roadmap
Introduction
This document outlines a comprehensive development roadmap for "Law by Keystone," an application designed to assist legal professionals by integrating advanced technological capabilities with a foundational commitment to Catholic Church teachings. This roadmap leverages the structure and components of the "Autonomous Criminal Defense Firm" Python package and the phased approach detailed in the "Roadmap to Application Manual," reorienting each stage to ensure that ethical considerations, human dignity, and the common good are central to the application's design, processes, algorithms, and data management.
The development will proceed through seven distinct phases, each building upon the last, to create a robust, secure, and ethically-aligned legal technology tool. Your development environment with Visual Studio Code and GitHub Copilot will be instrumental in implementing these phases efficiently, always with careful human oversight for critical ethical and logical components.
Guiding Principles for Integration
The development of "Law by Keystone" will be consistently guided by the following core principles derived from Catholic Social Teaching and moral theology:
1. The Inherent Dignity of the Human Person: All application features, data handling protocols, and AI interactions must respect and uphold the profound worth and dignity of every individual involved in or affected by the legal process.
2. The Pursuit of the Common Good: The application should be designed and utilized to contribute positively to society, promote justice, and support outcomes that benefit all members of the community, especially the vulnerable.
3. Solidarity and the Preferential Option for the Poor and Vulnerable: The system's design must consider and prioritize the needs of marginalized individuals and communities, ensuring fairness, equitable access to justice, and protection for those most at risk.
4. Truth, Justice, and Mercy: The application must strive for accuracy in information, support the administration of true justice, and incorporate considerations for mercy, rehabilitation, and restorative justice within the legal framework it supports.
5. Subsidiarity and Participation: Technology, including AI, should serve as a tool to augment human intellect and moral discernment, empowering legal professionals to make informed, responsible decisions, rather than replacing their judgment or diminishing their active participation.
6. Stewardship and Responsible Use of Technology: The application will be developed and deployed with a profound sense of responsibility, adhering to ethical guidelines for technology as articulated in Church documents, ensuring transparency, accountability, and a commitment to mitigating potential harms.
Phase 1: Ethically Grounded Foundation (Core Backend, Database & DevOps Basics)
Objective: Establish a stable, scalable, and maintainable core infrastructure that is architected from the outset to support and enforce the application's Catholic ethical framework.
Key Tasks & Focus Areas:
1. Database Design & Migration (with Ethical Schema):
   * Transition to a production-grade relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
   * Ethical Schema Elements: Design the database schema to include fields for ethical tagging (e.g., on Case, Document models), links to EthicalGuidelineRecord (see Phase 2), and any data points necessary for ethical analysis (e.g., vulnerability indicators for individuals).
   * Implement Alembic (Flask-Migrate) for schema version control.
   * Python Package Integration: Adapt knowledge_base.py concepts for data storage to fit the new ethical schema.
   * VS Code/Copilot: Assist with SQLAlchemy model definitions incorporating new ethical fields and migration script generation.
2. Configuration Management (Ethically Aware):
   * Implement law_by_keystone/config.py (as per your updated version) to support different environments and include:
      * DEFAULT_ETHICAL_FRAMEWORK_MODE (e.g., "standard", "catholic_teachings_aligned").
      * CATHOLIC_TEACHINGS_KB_PATH for sourcing curated ethical knowledge.
      * ETHICAL_GUIDELINES_STORAGE_PATH.
   * Python Package Integration: The config.py will directly influence how modules like knowledge_base.py and ethics.py behave.
3. Refactor Data Access Layer (Service/Repository with Ethical Querying):
   * Implement service and repository patterns to decouple database logic.
   * Design repositories to support queries filtered or prioritized by ethical tags or relevance to specific Catholic teachings.
   * VS Code/Copilot: Help generate service/repository boilerplate, focusing on methods that might later incorporate ethical filtering.
